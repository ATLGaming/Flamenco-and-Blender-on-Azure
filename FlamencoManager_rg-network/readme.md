# Network Template

This template deploys a vnet with two subnets. One for the Flamenco Manager node and one for the Flamenco Worker nodes.
A NIC or network interface is included in the manager subnet, pre-configured with the expected private IP address.
Network Security Groups with default settings are also created and associated with the subnets.
